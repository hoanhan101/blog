Jeff Bezos once said:

> I very frequently get the question: “What’s going to change in the next 10 years?” That’s a very interesting question. I almost never get the question: “What’s not going to change in the next 10 years?” And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two. You can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time. In our retail business, we know that customers want low prices, and I know that’s going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection. It’s impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, “Jeff I love Amazon, I just wish the prices were a little higher.” Or, “I love Amazon, I just wish you’d deliver a little slower.” Impossible.

That's a really interesting point of view. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter what the future holds, people will not stop caring about:
- Lower prices
- Faster solutions
- Greater control
- More choices
- More comfort
- Entertainment
- More transparency
- Less collateral damage
- Higher social status
- Increased confidence and trust
