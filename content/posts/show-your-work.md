A book for people who hate the very idea of self-promotion:
- Be an amateur, not afraid to voice your opinion, be willing to share.
- Document your process, start a journal, record it, take photo,...
- Share/publish something small everyday.
  - Once you finish your work for the day, reflect on it, share some of its process.
  - 90% of everything is crap. True for your own work. Don't be afraid to share. Some will find it interesting.
  - Build a good name that people can search through - way to build up your audience.
- Actionable ideas:
  - Blog everyday about my work, even if it’s code or things that I find interesting/informative or learn throughout the day.
  - Keep things that inspire you, share other artists' work.
  - Tell good stories. Remember Dan Harmon’s story circle, Kurt Vonnegut’s story graph. Gustav Freytag’s pyramid.
- Teach what you know, even though you've just started.
  - Share your reading lists, references,...
  - Create tutorials.
- Try to become a more interesting person.
- Learn to take a punch/criticism.
- Don't be afraid to charge for your work
- Don’t quit. Keep going. Keep producing one after another. But always remember to take rest
  - Short rest: exercise, take a walk, hike,...
  - Long rest: years off, sabbatical,...anything to help you recharge and ready for a new beginning.
