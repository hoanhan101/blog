        Content: Iâ€™m Hoanh, a software engineer and author. I've created [The Ultimate-Go Study Guide](https://github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go) to help people learn Go programming language better. The project has over 14K+ ðŸŒŸ on GitHub, an [eBook version](https://gumroad.com/l/bpUYF) that has sold over 3K+ copies in the first month of August 2020, and [a physical copy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1737384426/) that is available on Amazon since August 2021. Now, this blog is a new project of mine where I plan to share what I learn on different topics of software engineering, product development, entrepreneurship, decision making, wealth and happiness. Or really, whatever I am curious about at the time. I believe that by self-educating on these topics, I am investing a great deal in myself, my knowledge onto the world, my hobbies, my relationships that could help me live a more meaningful and fulfilling life. And this is just as important as mastering my technical craft. Hope you find that interesting and helpful too!
